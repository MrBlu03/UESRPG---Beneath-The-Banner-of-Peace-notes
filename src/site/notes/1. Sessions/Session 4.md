# Session 4 - 2025-03-02

## Summary
The party was summoned by [[Info/Characters/Queen_Freidr\|Queen Freidr]] to investigate a military keep called Harmugstahl that had gone silent three days ago. Upon arrival, they discovered the keep was eerily frozen, with soldiers and objects frozen solid. The party encountered mysterious voices, a frostbitten hand in the well, and a trail of black feathers similar to the one [[Info/Characters/Onasha\|Onasha]] found earlier. They also uncovered a logbook from the frozen general, which revealed the last entry: "It is inside now." The party found a cracked mirror in the dungeon, which reflected a mysterious Khajiit figure. They also discovered two symbols etched into the ground: the [[Info/Lore/Coiled_Serpent\|coiled serpent]] and a variation of the [[Info/Organizations/Clan_Volkihar\|Clan Volkihar]] symbol. After reporting their findings to the queen, they received their reward and were invited to become the "Fangs of Fjelhorst."

  - Military keep that's gone silent
  - Three days with no word
  - Scouts sent to investigate haven't returned
  - Unnaturally cold weather the day before the incident

### Journey to Harmugstahl
- The party embarked on a 5-hour walk to the keep.
  - They were followed by mysterious crows, which were later revealed to be **[[Info/Organizations/Court_of_Crows\|Court of Crows]]** messengers from the **[[Info/Locations/Nocturnal_Realm\|Nocturnal Realm]]**.
  - The crows spoke and acted as lookouts for the royal court.

### Investigation of Harmugstahl
- Upon arrival, the party found the keep unnaturally cold and silent.
  - Construction seemed old but completely abandoned.
  - No footprints apart from their own.
  - The courtyard was empty, with no signs of life.
  - A frostbitten hand was found in the well bucket, and the water was frozen solid all the way to the bottom.
  - Stables:
    - Trough was frozen.
    - Hay was almost frozen.
    - No signs of horses.
- **Barracks:**
  - Soldiers were frozen solid mid-action, their eyes still moving.
    - Some drawing swords, looking to the door.
    - Some kneeling in prayer.
    - Some writing letters.
  - Torches were lit but gave off dim light and nearly no heat.
  - The party heard mysterious voices.
    - "Gareth's little stray, still chasing ghosts?" (directed at [[Info/Characters/Periwyn\|Periwyn]], who threw a knife in response).
  - Torches flickered as a voice said: "All that faith, all that fire, and still you are afraid, you reek of Arkay's prayers."
  - A presence was felt in the room.
  - Through the window of the overseer's quarters, they glimpsed a reflection of a mysterious female shadowy Khajiit standing in the snow, which disappeared when they blinked.
  - A force rattled the shutters closed.
  - The smell of fresh blood filled the air.
  - Frozen soldiers turned in their places.
  - They saw breath in the darkest corner, but no form or silhouette was visible.
- **Dungeon:**
  - Air felt like it was slightly pushing the party.
  - A trail of black feathers led to a cracked mirror in the last cell.
  - The mirror reflected the same shadowy Khajiit figure who said, "They left them for you" before disappearing. Only [[Info/Characters/Kirya\|Kirya]] could see the figure during this supernatural encounter when all lights were extinguished.
  - All torches were suddenly extinguished.
  - In front of [[Info/Characters/Durov\|Durov]], [[Info/Characters/Kirya\|Kirya]] saw symbols appear as if drawn by an invisible hand.
  - Two symbols were etched into the ground:
    - The [[Info/Lore/Coiled_Serpent\|coiled serpent]] symbol.
    - A variation of the [[Info/Organizations/Clan_Volkihar\|Clan Volkihar]] symbol, suggesting a splinter faction.
  - A second gust of wind came from outside, turning the torches back on and leaving silence.
  - The presence had left.
  - Upon returning upstairs, they found the frozen soldiers had shattered into millions of pieces, like metal shavings.
  - The party did not recognize what magic could cause this.
