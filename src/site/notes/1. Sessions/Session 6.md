# Session 6 - 2025-04-26

## Summary
The party infiltrated [[Info/Locations/Greenwall\|Greenwall]] through a smuggler's tunnel while the [[Info/Organizations/Companions\|Companions]] provided a distraction with trebuchet fire. Inside the town, they discovered abandoned buildings, evidence of vampire attacks, and a disturbing Black Sacrament ritual site that summoned a member of the [[Info/Organizations/Dark_Brotherhood\|Dark_Brotherhood]] After striking a deal with the assassin to eliminate the source of the magical darkness, they explored the keep, finding a horrific ritual altar to [[Molag Bal\|Molag Bal]] with a mysterious crimson orb. The magical darkness lifted as the assassin completed his contract, and they rescued a barely alive man who had been tortured and suspended above the altar.

## Detailed Recap

### War Camp Preparations
- The party was awakened by [[Info/Characters/Hillevi\|Hillevi]], a [[Info/Organizations/Companions\|Companions]] member
- Many trebuchets had already been reassembled overnight
- [[Info/Characters/Periwyn\|Periwyn]] sketched people in the war tent while the group ate breakfast
  - The breakfast provided a strength bonus (+5 to strength checks) that would help them during their mission
- [[Info/Characters/Onasha\|Onasha]] and [[Info/Characters/Periwyn\|Periwyn]] discussed the bone hawk specimen in private:
  - [[Info/Characters/Periwyn\|Periwyn]] revealed she knows minor necromancy
  - They agreed to experiment with reanimating it later, away from other mages and away from the rest of the party
  - Agreed to use it for alchemical ingredients if they decided against necromancy
- [[Info/Characters/Onasha\|Onasha]] learned from [[Info/Characters/Hillevi\|Hillevi]] about the [[Info/Organizations/Companions\|Companions]]:
  - She had been with them for 6 years
  - They typically operate in The Rift region
  - Their members are either descendants or recruits following [[Ysgramor\|Ysgramor]]'s traditions
  - Their homeland is now a frozen wasteland
  - She joined seeking glory, entrance to Sovngarde, and to help people
  - The Companions operate from a large mead hall

### The Infiltration Plan
- [[Info/Characters/Vigrod_Wraithbane\|Vigrod_Wraithbane]] summoned the party to the war tent and outlined the plan:
  - The party would enter [[Info/Locations/Greenwall\|Greenwall]] through a hidden tunnel
  - The [[Info/Organizations/Companions\|Companions]] would launch flaming projectiles as a distraction
  - Once inside, they should head for the keep where the darkness likely originated
  - They received a sketched map of the area
  - Chances of finding survivors were deemed minimal

### Entering the Tunnel
- The tunnel entrance was hidden under fallen leaves, a wooden trapdoor on a small hill
- A 4-meter ladder led down to a torch-lit passage
- Marching order: [[Info/Characters/Durov\|Durov]], [[Info/Characters/Kirya\|Kirya]], [[Info/Characters/Onasha\|Onasha]], [[Info/Characters/Periwyn\|Periwyn]] (trailing behind due to anxiety)
- The tunnel was narrow with barely enough room to move past Durov if he stood in the middle

### Tunnel Exploration
- They found a small storage room where [[Info/Characters/Onasha\|Onasha]] discovered three books:
  - "Herbalist's Guide to Skyrim"
  - "Sithis"
  - "Herbane's Bestiary: Hagravens"
- A smuggler's logbook was found on a table
  - Detailed ledger of smuggled goods including skooma and slaves
- Further exploration revealed a larger room that appeared to be living quarters
  - Contained bedrolls and shackles
  - Initially seemed like a dead end until they noticed part of the wall was slightly offset
- The tunnel ended at a false wall (wooden panel) that [[Info/Characters/Durov\|Durov]] broke through with his axe
- This led to the basement of the local inn, accessible via a bookshelf door

### Inside Greenwall
- The inn was filled with dead bodies showing claw marks
- As they explored, trebuchet fire hit nearby buildings
- [[Info/Characters/Durov\|Durov]] tasted mead in the inn and noted it had a berry flavor
- The party maintained their formation as they stacked up to climb the stairs from the basement
- [[Info/Characters/Periwyn\|Periwyn]] found the innkeeper's room containing a metal safe
- [[Info/Characters/Kirya\|Kirya]] picked the lock, revealing:
  - 100 gold
  - A business ledger with concerning entries:
    - The captain of Greenwall had been absent-minded
    - Four strangers claiming nobility entered the keep 3 days prior
    - The town felt "wrong"
    - Reports of ghost lights on the 7th of Last Seed
    - Hunters reported empty woods on the 14th of Last Seed
    - The "nobles" were listed by name on the 20th of Last Seed: A. Vettien, M. Carcette, I. Tharn, V. Alvuin (at least two were Breton names, and all names were suspected aliases)
      - It was noted that I. Tharn couldn't be legitimate as the only Tharns are councilors
- Outside, they observed permafrost-covered ground and flaming debris
- Clouds of bats were seen flying toward the war camp, but eventually ceased
- The keep was visible on a small hill across town

### House Explorations
- Blacksmith's house:
  - Main floor: Three doses of dried elves ear herb
  - Basement: Smithing supplies and a piece of corundum ore (taken by [[Info/Characters/Durov\|Durov]])
    - Specifically found 4 pieces of corundum ore
- Final house before the keep:
  - Door was locked; [[Info/Characters/Kirya\|Kirya]] and [[Info/Characters/Onasha\|Onasha]] failed to pick it
  - [[Info/Characters/Durov\|Durov]] and [[Info/Characters/Periwyn\|Periwyn]] broke it down
  - Main floor: Furniture was largely intact
    - Small items were knocked over, but larger furniture remained in place
  - Basement: Contained a ritual site - the Black Sacrament

### The Dark Brotherhood
- The basement contained:
  - A circle of candles connected by dried blood
  - Human remains in the center
    - Included a skull, flesh, heart, and pieces of ribcage
  - A dull ebony dagger with strange runes
    - Similar to ones seen at statues in the Velothi mountains north on the road between Eastmarch and the region bordering Morrowind
  - A book titled "A Kiss, Sweet Mother"
- [[Info/Characters/Onasha\|Onasha]] recognized this as the Black Sacrament ritual to summon the [[Info/Organizations/Dark_Brotherhood\|Dark_Brotherhood]]
  - Explained that the ritual requires the remains of the intended victim
  - She freezes in panic and [[Info/Characters/Periwyn\|Periwyn]] rushes in to calm her back down
- As they returned upstairs, they encountered a figure shrouded in darkness
- The figure passed by them to the ritual site, kneeling and touching the circle
  - Green flames erupted, revealing a normal-sized man in dark clothing
  - He was about the size of Onasha
  - Appeared to be a Dunmer, though his face was obscured
  - He explained the sacrament had called him, and offered his services since the summoner was absent
  - He gave them one hour to provide a name for assassination
  - The assassin somehow knew [[Info/Characters/Periwyn\|Periwyn]]'s family name
  - The party contracted him to kill the mage responsible for [[Info/Locations/Greenwall\|Greenwall]]'s darkness
  - [[Info/Characters/Durov\|Durov]] signed the contract with his blood
  - The assassin dissolved into shadow to begin the hunt

### Lifting the Darkness
- The party waited in the building while the assassin worked
- After 15 minutes, trebuchet fire slowed significantly
- After 30 minutes, sunlight began to reappear
- Screams were heard from both the war camp and keep areas
- [[Info/Characters/Periwyn\|Periwyn]] recognized them as vampires burning in sunlight (she loved the sound of that)

### The Keep
- Inside the keep, they found a horrific scene:
  - Blood and body parts arranged in a spiral pattern
  - An altar to [[Molag Bal\|Molag Bal]] with blood flowing from the statue's mouth
  - A crimson orb floating on a pedestal
  - Behind the altar, a man was hanging with limbs impaled on rusted spears
- The victim was barely alive:
  - [[Info/Characters/Periwyn\|Periwyn]] cast healing magic to stabilize him
  - [[Info/Characters/Durov\|Durov]] gave him a potion that unexpectedly paralyzed him
  - They decided to leave him to recover while they explored further
- The crimson orb:
  - Appeared to be from [[Molag Bal\|Molag Bal]]'s realm
  - Resisted movement attempts by [[Info/Characters/Periwyn\|Periwyn]] and [[Info/Characters/Durov\|Durov]]
  - Deflected [[Info/Characters/Onasha\|Onasha]]'s silver arrow, emitting white-red lightning
- The [[Info/Organizations/Companions\|Companions]] arrived, reporting the orb emitted no detectable magic
- They freed the victim, with [[Info/Characters/Hillevi\|Hillevi]] providing healing but noting he was barely clinging to life
- [[Info/Characters/Periwyn\|Periwyn]] and [[Info/Characters/Durov\|Durov]] attempted to access ice-blocked doors
- Upon learning [[Info/Characters/Beitild\|Beitild]] and [[Info/Characters/Olen\|Olen]] had died, [[Info/Characters/Periwyn\|Periwyn]] cracked the ice wall in a rage
- The vampire's head dropped from the ceiling, confirming the assassination was complete
- The Dark Brotherhood assassin performed impressive parkour moves before departing
- The Dark Brotherhood assassin promised to collect payment later, saying "Your story seems interesting, we will meet again"

## Additional Context
- The inn ledger entries suggest the vampire infiltration was methodical and planned
- The "nobles" listed in the ledger are likely key vampires or cultists
- The [[Info/Organizations/Companions\|Companions]]' successful trebuchet attack provided crucial support
- The Black Sacrament ritual being performed in [[Info/Locations/Greenwall\|Greenwall]] suggests someone was desperate enough to call upon assassins
- The smuggler's tunnel beneath Greenwall was apparently used for trafficking skooma and slaves
