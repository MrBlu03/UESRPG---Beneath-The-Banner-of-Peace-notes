# Chapter 1: Wayfaring
Traveling across the lands of Tamriel can be challenging and dangerous. These rules will hopefully aid GMs and players get through the act of traversing the land in a timely and enjoyable fashion.  
## Step 1: Determine Pace and Mode of transportation
Before you head out on your journey, you must decide how hard you will push yourself on the road.

| Pace     | Speed        | Effect             |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Fast     | 7kph, 56/8h  | -10 to role checks |
| Moderate | 5kph, 40/8h  | ----               |
| Slow     | 3 kph, 24/8h | +10 on role checks |
Certain modes of transportation may affect your speed. These effects are listed below.

| Mode of Transport | Kph |
| ----------------- | --- |
| Horse             | +2  |
| Cart              | -2  |
| Carriage          | -1  |
While traveling through “Difficult Terrain”, your speed is reduced.  
- Rough Terrain (trackless woods): -1 kph & +2 Toll  
- Arduous Terrain (over a mountain): -2 kph & +3 Toll
## Step 2: Method of Rest
Camping: You resolve to camp out during your journey. Doing so increases the Journey’s Toll by 4 and requires 1 portion of Ratios for every character each day. Up to 2 characters can elect to improve the campsite as their Traveler Action, doing so calls for a Survival test and you combine both characters’ DoS and reduce the Journey’s Toll by half the total.

Inns: You have decided to rest in Inns. Doing so reduces the Journey’s Toll by 2 and costs 15 drakes per person. Inns are usually only found along main roads and are rare on smaller paths. 

Rotations: While traveling on a Carriage, if the party has multiple “Pilots”, they can take turns driving and resting. If the party has 2 drivers, they receive no penalties to their condition at the end of the journey. With 3+ pilots, the party will gain a +1 to their condition.
## Step 3: Determine Traveler Action
Each Character may elect to perform one of the following Actions to aid in the Journey. Characters may change their Action or roll the same one again for every leg of the Journey.  
For every test that fails, you add 5 to the Journey’s Toll. For every character that doesn’t choose a Traveler Action, you increase the Journey’s Toll by 2.
### Scouting
You may elect to hasten your Journey by scouting ahead for short cuts and to avoid obstacles. This calls for an Observe Test and will increase your pace by +2 if successful and +3 if you roll an advantage.
### Piloting
Using a Carriage, Cart, or other vehicle requires at least one character to roll an appropriate skill of Ride, Profession (Animal Handling) or Profession (Engineer) Test, based on the exact type of vehicle, and reduces the Journey’s Toll by the test’s DoS/2 or the full DoS if you roll an advantage.
### Healer
You may elect to lend medical aid to a wounded or ill character during the Journey. Doing so allows you to roll either a Restoration or Profession (Medicine) test, restoring their Health, Magicka, and Stamina by their natural recovery rate, doubling this recovery and curing a common disease on an advantage.
### Assist
You may elect to aid another traveler in their Role, doing so will reduce the Toll taken from a failed test by 1 per assistant, to a max of 3.
### Guarding
You may make an Observe test to keep an eye out for threats. If you are successful, if you are attacked, you and one other player cannot be surprised. If you roll an advantage, none of the party members can be surprised, and you and one other player gain 1 free action at the start of combat. 
### Hunting
If you choose not to consume a Ration, or lack one, you may elect to Hunt for nearby animals. Doing so reduces your pace by 1 kph. The rules for Hunting can be found in Chapter 3 of this guide.
## The Journey’s Toll
Every choice the party makes increases the Journey’s Toll and at the end of each Leg the Gamemaster tallies up the Toll and the party must divide it between them as they see fit.

The following adverse conditions are the different effects that Toll can cause during your Journey. At the start of the next Leg, you make an Endurance test at the difficulty listed on the chart to resist the effect for the leg and the GM rolls 1d10 on the Affliction chart to determine what happens to the character.  
Any reference to an X value is equal to the amount of Toll that is assigned to the character.

| Toll | Test |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1-5  | 0    |
| 6-9  | -15  |
| 10+  | -30  |
### Afflictions

| Roll | Affliction                                                                                                     |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-3  | Due to an accident, your Wound Threshold is reduced by X. This recovers by 1 per day spent resting.            |
| 4-5  | You contract a Common Disease at stage 1.                                                                      |
| 6-7  | A Minor injury prevents you from taking a Traveler Action on the next Leg.                                     |
| 8-10 | Your poor condition and weary form results in a lack of focus. You gain a -5*X penalty to all tests for 1 day. |
### Additional Condition
There are a few more things that can affect the Toll of a Journey other than those listed above. These conditions are applied at the start of each Leg.
Sick and Wounded travelers: Travelers that have 4+ wounds or are suffering from a disease at Stage 2+, can’t perform any Traveler Actions.  
Extreme Temperatures: Traveling in conditions of extreme temperatures, such as traversing a Desert in the summer or the Cold North during Winter, decreases your pace by 1 kph and increases your Toll by 5.
## Happenings on the Path
While traveling, the party may encounter certain happenings that will either help or hinder their path. These are different from planned encounters. At the end of each leg, the GM will tally up all Critical Failures and Successes and determine whether a Complication or a Favor occurs. The different outcomes have the following values associated with them.

| Result    | Value          |
| --------- | -------------- |
| Crit Fail | 1 Complication |
| Crit Pass | 1 Favor        |
Complications and Favors cancel each other out, so if you total 2 Favors and 3 Complications, then the end result is a Complication with an X of 1.

# Chapter 2: Surviving Harsh Weather
Surviving in the vast weather occurrences present on Tamriel can be a challenge. Some races are far more equipped to handle different storms, from Dunmer knowing how to handle the ash storms of Vvardenfell, to Nords toughing out harsh blizzards. Defined below are the basic rules for surviving in these storms.  
## Severity and Exposure Gain
For every hex a character passes through, they must make an Endurance test modified by how extreme the weather is. The severity of the weather is registered from 0-5, zero meaning the climate is not a problem at all, while the higher on the scale the harder the tests get to resist the effects of exposure. The penalties of failing a test are laid out in the chart below.

| Severity | Test Penalty | Exposure gain |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 0        | None made    | None gained   |
| 1        | -0           | +1            |
| 2        | -10          | +1            |
| 3        | -20          | +2            |
| 4        | -30          | +2            |
| 5        | -40          | +3            |
## The Effects of Exposure
Each time you fail a test, you gain a point of Exposure. The following chart shows the effects of the different stages.

| Exposure | Effect                                        |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | +1 level of fatigue                           |
| 2        | You gain Minor Frostbite or Minor Heat Stroke |
| 3        | +2 levels of fatigue                          |
| 4        | You gain Major Frostbite or Major Heat Stroke |
| 5        | You gain Hypothermia or Hyperthermia          |
- Minor Frostbite: Max SP is reduced by 1 and -10 penalty to Agility tests.
- Minor Heat Stroke: Max SP is reduced by 1 and -10 penalty to Strength tests.
- Major Frostbite: Max SP is reduced by 3 and -20 penalty to Agility tests.
- Major Heat Stroke: Max SP is reduced by 3 and -20 penalty to Strength tests.
- Hyperthermia: Max SP is reduced by 5, -40 on Agility tests.
- Hyperthermia: Max SP is reduced by 5, -40 on Strength tests.
## Regional Severity Examples

Detailed here are some examples on weather severity across the continent.

| --------           | Severity |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| The Alik’r Desert  | 4        |
| The Pale of Skyrim | 4        |
| County Bruma       | 3        |
| Colovian Highlands | 2        |
| Anequina           | 3        |
## Seasons and Storms
The regional severity should change with the seasons. During Winter, the severity for cold areas should increase by 1 and hot areas decrease by 1, and vice versa. While in a severe storm, such as a blizzard or sandstorm, you should increase the severity by 1.
## Resistances and Equipment
Characters with resistance to fire/frost can add their modifier to Exposure tests while in the appropriate weather. Wearing 3 pieces of armor with fire/frost AR grants a +10 to your Exposure tests while in the appropriate weather, which increases to +20 if all 6 pieces have this AR.
## Hunger & Thirst
To explore the varying fauna of Tamriel, and the many interesting dishes, I have included Hunger & Thirst rules.
### Penalties of Hunger
For every day you go without food, you suffer a -1 penalty to your recovered HP. When this penalty is equal to twice your Endurance Bonus, you fall unconscious.
### Penalties of Thirst
This acts the same way Hunger does, but it stacks with it making you fall unconscious faster. 
# Chapter 3: Hunting
“Let no man say before a witness that the Hunt has not been called, nor the Rites declared, or the Ancient Offices observed.” – The Posting of the Hunt  
## Hunting
These rules are used by those who hunt with Bows, Spears, Javelins, and other weapons.
### Step 1: Declaring the Hunt
The hunter must declare what it is they wish to hunt and must apply the following modifier to their Bounty Check to determine whether or not they find what they are searching for.

| Prey            | Modifier |
| --------------- | -------- |
| Small Game      | +20      |
| Large Game      | +10      |
| Common Predator | +10      |
| Apex Predator   | +0       |
| Mythic Prey     | -30      |
- Small Game: rabbits, foxes, squirrels, birds, small lizards, raccoons, hedgehogs, etc.
- Large Game: deer, moose, elk, antelopes, large lizards, giant insects, bison, rams, small whales, etc.
- Common Predator: Wolves, bears, sabre cats, cliff racers
- Apex Predator: Snowy Sabre Cats, Cave bears, sabre cat matrons
- Mythic Prey: unique creatures
	- Mythic Prey is chosen by the GM as part of a quest or adventure.
### Step 2: Determine Bounty
The hunt begins with a Luck Test, henceforth called the “Bounty Check”, that is modified by a value based on how bountiful the hunting ground is. A failed test results in a hunt without prey, while a successful one continues with the following steps. The DoS of the Bounty Check is capped at the combined rank of the Hunter’s Survival & Observe skills.
### Step 3: Tracking the Prey
After a successful Bounty Check, you manage to find tracks of your desired prey. The hunter and prey must make an opposed Survival (Tracking) vs the prey’s Stealth skill test. The Prey receives a modifier to this test based on the DoS of the Bounty Check shown on the chart below.

| Bounty DoS | Modifier |
| ---------- | -------- |
| 1-3        | +10      |
| 4-6        | +0       |
| 7-9        | -10      |
| 10+        | -20      |
If the Prey wins, the hunter loses the tracks and must restart the Hunt.  
If the Hunter wins, they find their prey and then make a Stealth (Stalking) Test vs the Prey’s Observe skill.  
If the Prey notices the Hunter, move on to “Step 5: Pursuit” or enter combat. If the Hunter goes unnoticed, move on to “Step 4: The Kill”.
### Step 4: The Kill
While unnoticed, the Hunter must make an attack roll against the unaware Prey. Based on the weapon type used, follow the rules below.

Ranged Weapons  
Make an attack roll and resolve the damage as normal. If the attack misses, the Prey is alerted, and they move on to Step 5 or enter combat.

 Melee Weapons  
The Hunter and Prey roll initiative, with the Hunter adding the Reach of their weapon to their Initiative. If the Prey wins, move on to Step 5 or enter combat. If the Hunter wins, roll an attack roll and resolve damage as normal. If the attack misses, the Prey is alerted, and they move on to Step 5 or enter combat.
### Step 5: The Pursuit
The Hunter and the Prey roll Initiative (even if the hunter used a melee weapon) and the Prey may substitute their Speed for their initiative Rating. If the Hunter wins, they get to make another attack. If the Prey wins, note down the difference in initiative, this number becomes the “Chase Threshold”. Then they make an Opposed test; Prey’s Evade vs Hunter’s Athletics. If the Prey wins, they add the difference between tests to the Chase Threshold. If the Hunter wins, they reduce the Chase Threshold by the difference instead.

If the Chase Threshold reaches 0, the Hunter gets to make another attack against the prey, repeating the process until they die.

If the Chase Threshold ever exceeds the Hunter’s Speed, the Prey escapes and the hunt ends. 

If either the Evade or Athletics tests result in Advantage (pass vs fail), the Chase Threshold either drops to 0 or exceeds the Hunter’s Speed, in favor of the victor.

If the Hunter is using a ranged weapon, they may make an attack roll instead of an Athletics test during the pursuit. If the roll is successful, but loses in DoS, it fails and counts as a DoS equal to the Hunter’s rank in Athletics skill for increasing the Chase Threshold. 

## Trapping
### Step 1: Setting the Trap
The Hunter must choose what trap and lure to use and note the benefits of it, info found in the Appendix.
### Step 2: Determine Bounty
See “Hunting” Step 2.
### Step 3: Lure Test
The Prey makes an Observe test modified by the quality of the Lure used in the trap. If they fail, the Prey gets caught.
