# Chapter 1: Wayfaring

Traveling across the lands of Tamriel can be challenging and dangerous. These rules will hopefully aid GMs and players in traversing the land in a timely and enjoyable fashion.

---

## Step 1: Determine Pace and Mode of Transportation

Before setting out on your journey, decide how hard you will push yourself on the road.

### Pace Table

| Pace     | Speed       | Effect               |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Fast     | 7 kph (56 km/8h) | -10 to role checks     |
| Moderate | 5 kph (40 km/8h) | —                    |
| Slow     | 3 kph (24 km/8h) | +10 on role checks     |

### Transportation Modifiers

| Mode of Transport | Speed Modifier |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Horse             | +2 kph         |
| Cart              | -2 kph         |
| Carriage          | -1 kph         |

### Difficult Terrain

- **Rough Terrain** (e.g. trackless woods): -1 kph, +2 Toll  
- **Arduous Terrain** (e.g. mountain): -2 kph, +3 Toll

---

## Step 2: Method of Rest

### Camping

- Increases Journey’s Toll by **4**
- Requires **1 Ration** per character per day
- Up to 2 characters may improve the campsite as their Traveler Action (Survival test)
  - Combine both DoS, reduce Journey’s Toll by **half total DoS**

### Inns

- Reduces Journey’s Toll by **2**
- Costs **15 drakes** per person
- Typically found only along main roads

### Rotations (Carriages only)

- If 2 drivers: No condition penalty at journey's end
- If 3+ drivers: Party gains **+1 to condition**

---

## Step 3: Determine Traveler Action

Each character may perform **1 Traveler Action** per leg of the journey.  
Changing or repeating actions is allowed each leg.

- Failed test: **+5 Toll**
- No Traveler Action: **+2 Toll**

### Available Traveler Actions

#### Scouting
- **Test**: Observe
- **Success**: +2 Pace
- **Advantage**: +3 Pace

#### Piloting
- Required when using Carriage/Cart/Vehicle
- **Test**: Ride, Profession (Animal Handling), or Profession (Engineer)
- **Success**: Reduces Toll by DoS / 2  
- **Advantage**: Reduces Toll by full DoS

#### Healer
- **Test**: Restoration or Profession (Medicine)
- **Success**: Restores HP, Magicka, Stamina by natural recovery
- **Advantage**: Double recovery + cure a common disease

#### Assist
- Aid another traveler
- Reduces Toll from failed test by **1 per assistant**, max **3**

#### Guarding
- **Test**: Observe
- **Success**: You + 1 other can't be surprised if attacked
- **Advantage**: No party surprise; you + 1 get 1 free action at start of combat

#### Hunting
- Used if lacking Ration or to avoid using one
- Reduces pace by **1 kph**
- **See Chapter 3** for Hunting rules

---

## The Journey’s Toll

At the end of each Leg, the GM totals the Toll. The party must **divide the Toll** however they choose.

### Endurance Test to Resist Toll Effects

| Toll Range | Endurance Modifier |
|------------|--------------------|
| 1–5        | 0                  |
| 6–9        | -15                |
| 10+        | -30                |

Then, roll **1d10** on the **Affliction Table**.

### Affliction Table

| Roll | Effect                                                                                 |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1–3  | Wound Threshold reduced by **X** (recovers by 1 per day resting)                      |
| 4–5  | Contract a **Common Disease** at Stage 1                                               |
| 6–7  | Minor injury — cannot take Traveler Action on next leg                                |
| 8–10 | -5×X penalty to **all tests** for 1 day due to poor condition                         |

---

## Additional Conditions

- **Sick/Wounded Travelers** (4+ wounds or Stage 2+ Disease): Cannot perform Traveler Actions
- **Extreme Temperatures** (Desert Summer / Northern Winter):  
  - Pace: -1 kph  
  - Toll: +5

---

## Happenings on the Path

At the end of each Leg, total **Critical Successes and Failures**.

- Each **Crit Fail** = 1 **Complication**
- Each **Crit Pass** = 1 **Favor**

These cancel out 1:1.

> Example: 2 Favors, 3 Complications → Net = 1 Complication (X=1)

---

# Chapter 2: Surviving Harsh Weather

Surviving in the vast weather occurrences present on Tamriel can be a challenge. Some races are far more equipped to handle different storms, from Dunmer knowing how to handle the ash storms of Vvardenfell, to Nords toughing out harsh blizzards. Defined below are the basic rules for surviving in these storms.

---

## Severity and Exposure Gain

For every hex a character passes through, they must make an Endurance test modified by how extreme the weather is. The severity of the weather is registered from 0–5, zero meaning the climate is not a problem at all, while the higher on the scale, the harder the tests get to resist the effects of exposure. The penalties of failing a test are laid out in the chart below.

| Severity | Test Penalty | Exposure Gain |
| -------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| 0        | None made     | None gained    |
| 1        | -0            | +1             |
| 2        | -10           | +1             |
| 3        | -20           | +2             |
| 4        | -30           | +2             |
| 5        | -40           | +3             |

---

## The Effects of Exposure

Each time you fail a test, you gain a point of Exposure. The following chart shows the effects of the different stages.

| Exposure | Effect                                        |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | +1 level of fatigue                           |
| 2        | You gain Minor Frostbite or Minor Heat Stroke |
| 3        | +2 levels of fatigue                          |
| 4        | You gain Major Frostbite or Major Heat Stroke |
| 5        | You gain Hypothermia or Hyperthermia          |

- **Minor Frostbite**: Max SP is reduced by 1 and -10 penalty to Agility tests.  
- **Minor Heat Stroke**: Max SP is reduced by 1 and -10 penalty to Strength tests.  
- **Major Frostbite**: Max SP is reduced by 3 and -20 penalty to Agility tests.  
- **Major Heat Stroke**: Max SP is reduced by 3 and -20 penalty to Strength tests.  
- **Hypothermia**: Max SP is reduced by 5, -40 on Agility tests.  
- **Hyperthermia**: Max SP is reduced by 5, -40 on Strength tests.

## Regional Severity Examples

Detailed here are some examples on weather severity across the continent.

| Region              | Severity |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| The Alik’r Desert  | 4        |
| The Pale of Skyrim | 4        |
| County Bruma       | 3        |
| Colovian Highlands | 2        |
| Anequina           | 3        |

---

## Seasons and Storms

The regional severity should change with the seasons.  
- **Winter**: Increase severity for cold areas by 1; decrease for hot areas by 1.  
- **Summer**: Increase severity for hot areas by 1; decrease for cold areas by 1.  
- **Severe Storms** (e.g. blizzards, sandstorms): Increase severity by 1.

---

## Resistances and Equipment

- Characters with resistance to fire/frost can add their modifier to Exposure tests in appropriate climates.  
- Wearing **3 pieces** of armor with **fire/frost AR**: +10 to Exposure tests.  
- Wearing **6 pieces**: +20 to Exposure tests.

---

## Hunger & Thirst

To explore the varying fauna of Tamriel, and the many interesting dishes, I have included Hunger & Thirst rules.

### Penalties of Hunger

- For **each day** without food, suffer a **-1 penalty to recovered HP**.  
- When this penalty equals **2 × your Endurance Bonus**, you fall unconscious.

### Penalties of Thirst

- Acts the same way as Hunger.  
- **Stacks** with Hunger, making unconsciousness come faster.

---

# Chapter 3: Hunting
*“Let no man say before a witness that the Hunt has not been called, nor the Rites declared, or the Ancient Offices observed.”*  
– *The Posting of the Hunt*

## Hunting

These rules are used by those who hunt with bows, spears, javelins, and other weapons.

---

### Step 1: Declaring the Hunt

Declare the target of your hunt. Apply the following modifier to the **Bounty Check** (a Luck test) to determine whether you encounter your chosen prey.

| Prey Type        | Modifier |
|------------------|----------|
| Small Game       | +20      |
| Large Game       | +10      |
| Common Predator  | +10      |
| Apex Predator    | +0       |
| Mythic Prey      | -30      |

- **Small Game**: rabbits, foxes, birds, lizards, etc.  
- **Large Game**: deer, elk, giant insects, etc.  
- **Common Predators**: wolves, bears, cliff racers  
- **Apex Predators**: cave bears, snowy sabre cats  
- **Mythic Prey**: rare or unique creatures; GM-defined quest prey

---

### Step 2: Determine Bounty

Roll a **Bounty Check** (Luck test), modified by terrain bounty level and target modifier. A failed test means no prey is found.

- Success: Proceed to tracking  
- DoS is capped at the sum of the Hunter’s **Survival + Observe ranks**

---

### Step 3: Tracking the Prey

Hunter rolls **Survival (Tracking)** vs. prey’s **Stealth**, modified by Bounty DoS:

| Bounty DoS | Prey Stealth Modifier |
|------------|-----------------------|
| 1–3        | +10                   |
| 4–6        | +0                    |
| 7–9        | -10                   |
| 10+        | -20                   |

- **Hunter loses**: Tracks are lost; restart the hunt  
- **Hunter wins**: Proceed to **Stalking**

#### Stalking

Hunter rolls **Stealth** vs. Prey’s **Observe**

- **Prey wins**: Move to **Step 5: Pursuit** or enter combat  
- **Hunter wins**: Proceed to **Step 4: The Kill**

---

### Step 4: The Kill

Hunter gets a surprise attack:

#### Ranged Weapon

- Attack as normal  
- **Miss**: Prey is alerted, go to Pursuit or combat

#### Melee Weapon

- Both roll Initiative  
  - Hunter adds weapon **Reach** to initiative  
- **Prey wins**: Alerted, go to Pursuit or combat  
- **Hunter wins**: Make attack  
  - **Miss**: Alerted, go to Pursuit or combat

---

### Step 5: The Pursuit

- Both roll **Initiative**
  - Prey may substitute **Speed** for Initiative

#### Result:

- **Hunter wins**: May attack again  
- **Prey wins**:
  - Note initiative difference = **Chase Threshold**

#### Chase Test:

Opposed Test:  
- **Prey’s Evade** vs **Hunter’s Athletics**

- **Winner** increases/decreases Chase Threshold by the difference  
- **Chase Threshold = 0**: Hunter gets another attack  
- **Chase Threshold > Hunter’s Speed**: Prey escapes

##### Advantage:

- If one side passes and the other fails:  
  - Threshold instantly reaches 0 (Hunter wins) or exceeds Hunter's Speed (Prey escapes)

##### Ranged Option:

- Instead of Athletics, Hunter may attempt an attack
  - If successful **but** loses on DoS: Prey escapes by amount equal to Hunter’s Athletics **rank**

---

## Trapping

### Step 1: Set the Trap

Select appropriate trap and lure (see Appendix). Trap must match prey type.

### Step 2: Determine Bounty

Same as Step 2 of **Hunting** rules.

### Step 3: Lure Test

- Prey rolls **Observe**  
  - Modified by Lure quality  
  - If they fail, they're caught in the trap
