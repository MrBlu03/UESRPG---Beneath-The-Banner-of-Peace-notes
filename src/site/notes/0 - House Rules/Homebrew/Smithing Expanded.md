An adaptation of weapon modifications from the Book of Circles, and an expansion of crafting material requirements. Credit goes to all involved with the Book of Circles, as well as Tutorial.tuna for crafting times.
# New Crafting Steps
## Step 1: Determine Item
First, the character must choose the item they wish to create. Some items cannot be created, such as those that only occur naturally, so the GM should use discretion when determining if a character can craft an item. The character must also choose the quality of the item, if applicable, which when combined with the item’s base price will allow them to determine the approximate market value of the item.
### Step 1a: Determine Modification
When an item has been chosen, you can pick one or more modifications from the Weapon, Shield, or Armor table below, which specifies the effect and difficulty of each. The number of upgrades that can be applied to the item (every level of scaled upgrades counts to this level) is equal to half the character's Profession: Smithing rank rounded up (1 for rank 1, 3 for rank 5).
## Step 2: Gather Raw Materials
Next the character must gather the raw materials necessary to create the item, and any desired modifications. Exactly what this entails will vary from item to item, and the details can be found in the “Material Requirements & Crafting Time” chapter of this document.
## Step 3: Determine Test Difficulty

Third, the character determines the difficulty of the crafting test. The difficulty of the crafting test for most items is based solely on the quality of the item, and modified further as the GM sees fit. When creating weapons or armor the material also provides a modifier. See the tables below for test difficulties.
### Step 3a: Modify Test Difficulty
After determining the initial test difficulty, add the relevant modifiers from any applied modifications to determine the final test difficulty that will be used in Step 4.
## Step 4: Make Crafting Test
Next the character makes the actual crafting test using the difficulty determined in the previous step. The skill that the character tests is based on the item they wish to craft. Creating weapons or armor uses the Profession: Smithing skill, while other items will usually use some other variation of the Profession: Field skill as appropriate. Failure produces no item, while critical success halves the time required. Creating any items requires the appropriate craft tools. In the case of smithing, the character will also need access to a forge (along with the related facilities and tools) in order to complete the product. The actual act of crafting can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days (and sometimes even longer). During this time the character must be focused on creating the item. The duration required is left to the GM and should be based on the complexity of the item in question.
## Runed Weapons & Armor
Characters with the knowledge of Enchanting can imbue weapons and armor with magic runes that make them effective against certain types of enemies. The character must pass an Enchant test when creating the item. On success, add the Magic quality to the armor or weapon, along with +1 magic AR to the armor. On failure, the item is created without the Magic quality and the test cannot be repeated for this item.
## Repairing Weapons & Armor
Much like people, gear does not always survive combat. In the event that a weapon or piece of armor is damaged, a character can attempt to repair it with a Profession: Smithing skill test. This takes about an hour and requires 1 unit of the core material used to craft the item.  Given a successful skill test, the character can reduce the X value of the Damaged(X) weapon/armor quality on the damaged item by their degrees of success.

# Material Requirements & Crafting Time
## Materials
The table below details the required components, divided into the Core Materials and Fastenings. The Core material is whatever the Stats you want the item to have, such as Iron, Steel, Leather, or Mithril. Fastenings is a catch-all term for several small items needed to finish an item, such as paddings, straps and clasps.

| Item             | Core    | Fastenings |
| ---------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Partial Chest    | 3 Units | 3          |
| Full Chest       | 5 Units | 4          |
| Partial Limb     | 1 Unit  | 1          |
| Full Limb        | 2 Units | 2          |
| Shield           | 3 Units | 2          |
| Buckler          | 1 Unit  | 1          |
| Tower Shield     | 4 Units | 3          |
| Targe            | 2 Units | 1          |
| 1H Weapons       | 1 Unit  | 1          |
| 1.5H Weapons     | 2 Units | 2          |
| 2H Weapons       | 3 Units | 3          |
| Small Misc.      | 1 Unit  | 1          |
| Medium Misc.     | 2 Units | 2          |
| Large Misc.      | 4 Units | 3          |
| 10, Arrows/Bolts | 1 Unit  | 1          |
| Complex Weapon   | 2 Units | 4          |
| Bows             | 1 Units | 3          |

Repairing equipment only ever requires 1 unit per test.
Making a single unit of a core material requires 2 units of the raw equivalent, except in the case of Steel, which is an alloy requiring 2 raw Iron and 1 raw Corundum.
In the case of Hide, Leather, and Fur, 2 animal hides can be used to create 1 unit of hide or leather, and 1 pelt can be turned into 1 unit of fur.
Fastenings are created from leather units, where 1 leather unit makes 4 fastenings.

**Material Unit Costs**
Due to inconsistencies presented by the “1/3rd of the price of the item” rule in the Rules Compendium, prices of crafting materials have been adjusted. All units have a weight of 0.2, except for Fastenings which have a weight of 0.1
This does make several items more expensive to make, but it also makes the more expensive items far cheaper.

| Material    | Cost |
| ----------- | ---- |
| Fastening   | 1    |
| Chitin      | 6    |
| Cloth       | 1    |
| Hide        | 3    |
| Fur         | 4    |
| Leather     | 5    |
| Iron        | 10   |
| Steel       | 20   |
| Bonemold    | 10   |
| Moonstone   | 20   |
| Dreugh Hide | 25   |
| Mithril     | 70   |
| Dwemer      | 30   |
| Orichalcum  | 25   |
| Adamantium  | 80   |
| Malachite   | 150  |
| Stalhrim    | 300  |
| Ebony       | 200  |
| Dragonbone  | 1000 |

## Crafting time
Below is a table of crafting times based on item type. For this, a full day of work counts 12 hours.

| Item             | Time     |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| Partial Chest    | 24 hours |
| Full Chest       | 36 hours |
| Partial Limb     | 12 hours |
| Full Limb        | 18 hours |
| Shield           | 24 hours |
| Buckler          | 12 hours |
| Tower Shield     | 36 hours |
| Targe            | 18 hours |
| 1H Weapons       | 24 hours |
| 1.5H Weapons     | 36 hours |
| 2H Weapons       | 48 hours |
| Small Misc.      | 6 hours  |
| Medium Misc.     | 12 hours |
| Large Misc.      | 18 hours |
| 10, Arrows/Bolts | 12 hours |
| Complex Weapon   | 48 hours |
| Bows             | 36 hours |


Additionally, when picking material, every -10 of difficulty increases the crafting time by 6 hours.
For modifications, each -10 increases the time by an additional 2 hours.
