# Alchemical Forms
All potions and toxins are given a Form during their creation. This Form lends certain modifiers and uses to them.  
## Elixirs
Use: Drink  
Duration: Instant  
Solvent: Water  
Modifiers: multiply Potency by Magnitude
## Tincture
Use: Drink  
Duration: Prolonged  
Solvent: Alcohol  
Modifiers: refreshes every turn for 1 + Magnitude rounds
## Varnishes
Use: Applied  
Duration: Instant  
Solvent: Grease  
Modifiers: applied to an item or surface, has Magnitude uses
## Bombs
Use: Thrown (2xSB/3xSB/4xSB)  
Duration: Instant  
Solvent: Oil  
Modifiers: explodes on contact in Magnitude radius
# Brewing
## Pick Alchemical Form
## Pick Ingredients and Solvent
## Calculate Magnitude and Potency
Potency: number next to the ingredients, add those together  
Magnitude: based on whether the effect is Major or Minor.
Major + Major = 3 Magnitude  
Major + Minor = 2 Magnitude  
Minor + Minor = 1 Magnitude
## Alchemy Test
The difficulty of the test is based on Magnitude. This takes place over a Short Rest.  
M 1 = -0  
M 2 = -10  
M 3 = -20
## The Result
You create a number of potions per successful test based on your Degrees of Success. Critically succeeding doubles the DoS, failing results in the loss of components, and critically failing also causes an “Alchemical Backfire” (see Rules Compendium).

DoS of 1-4 = 1 potion  
DoS of 5-8 = 2 potions  
DoS of 9-12 = 3 potions  
DoS of 13+ = 4 potions
## Distilling Solvents
All solvents need to be prepared (or bought) before use. Preparing them takes a short rest and is a +20 Alchemy test.
# Talents  
## Existing Talents
### Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained
Adept (Int)  
The character can choose to disregard normal safety procedures when creating a concoction. When doing so, they gain a +20 bonus on their Alchemy skill test, but the potion backfires if they roll doubles. If the test fails it automatically backfires (roll a d4 on the appropriate backfire table and add the combined Potency to the result). Ignore Master Alchemist when using this effect.
### Trial and Error
Journeyman (Int)  
The character gains a cumulative +10 modifier on Alchemy tests made to create a concoction if their last Alchemy test was a failed attempt to create the same concoction (max +30).  
## Reworked Talents
### Alchemist
Apprentice (Int)
The character increases the Potency of all concoctions by 1.
### Master Alchemist
Master (Int)
The character increases the Potency of all concoctions by 2 (stacks to 3 with Alchemist). Additionally, the character never suffers from alchemical backfires.
## New Talents
### Medicinal Use
Journeyman (Int)
All Tinctures you consume have their duration increased by 1 minute.
### Poisoner
Apprentice (Int)
Any poison you create adds an additional -10 penalty to resist it.
### Grenadier
Journeyman (Int)
All bombs you make have a +1 to their AoE.
