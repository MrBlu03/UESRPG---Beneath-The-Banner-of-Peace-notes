## ðŸ§ª Alchemical Forms

All potions and toxins have a **Form**, which determines how they function.

| Form     | Use      | Duration    | Solvent  | Modifiers |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Elixirs**   | Drink    | Instant     | Water    | Multiply **Potency Ã— Magnitude** |
| **Tinctures** | Drink    | Prolonged   | Alcohol  | Refreshes **each turn** for **1 + Magnitude** rounds |
| **Varnishes** | Applied  | Instant     | Grease   | Apply to surface/item, has **Magnitude uses** |
| **Bombs**     | Thrown (2xSB/3xSB/4xSB) | Instant | Oil      | Explodes on contact, **Magnitude radius** |

## ðŸ§« Brewing Process

1. **Pick Alchemical Form**  
2. **Select Ingredients + Solvent**  
3. **Calculate Potency & Magnitude**  
   - **Potency** = Sum of Potency values from ingredients  
   - **Magnitude** depends on effects:  
     - Major + Major = 3  
     - Major + Minor = 2  
     - Minor + Minor = 1  
4. **Alchemy Test** (Short Rest)  
   - Based on Magnitude:
     - M1 = no penalty  
     - M2 = -10  
     - M3 = -20  
5. **Results**  
   - Based on **Degrees of Success (DoS)**:  
     - 1â€“4 DoS = 1 potion  
     - 5â€“8 DoS = 2 potions  
     - 9â€“12 DoS = 3 potions  
     - 13+ DoS = 4 potions  
   - **Critical Success**: Doubles DoS  
   - **Failure**: Lose ingredients  
   - **Critical Failure**: Backfire (see Compendium)
