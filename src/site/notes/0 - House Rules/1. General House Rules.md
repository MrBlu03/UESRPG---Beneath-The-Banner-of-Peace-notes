# Beneath the Banner of Peace – House Rules

## Downtime

### Skill Training _(credit to Greybard)_

Characters can hone their skills without spending XP by undergoing training.

To advance a skill to the next rank, a character must successfully complete at least **`next skill rank + 1`** training sessions. These do **not** need to be consecutive.

#### Training Sessions

A **training session** is a period of 8 hours in which a trainer teaches a specific skill. At the start, the player selects the skill to train.

- **Skill Test:**  
  - Starts at +0 difficulty.  
  - If failed, the next session gains a **+10 bonus**.  
  - If passed, the next session has a **-10 penalty** and the session counts as successful.

- **Daily Limit:**  
  - Up to **two sessions per day** are allowed, if both trainer and trainee are available.

- **Cost:**  
  - Generally, **`(next skill rank + 1) × 40` Drakes** per session.  
  - Costs may vary based on faction, fame, or relationship with the trainer.

## Session 0 – Group Norms

### Player & GM Behavior

#### Unannounced Dice Rolls

You may roll for nearly anything—**just tell me beforehand**, so I can apply modifiers.

#### Inter-Player Conflict

- **Conflict is prohibited. Banter is allowed.**  
- Insults must **target the character, not the player**.  
- Sparring is fine—**attempted murder is not**.

#### PC Secrets & META Knowledge

- Secrets are encouraged.  
- **Meta-knowledge is prohibited**—if your character didn’t learn it, you don’t know it.

#### Player Discomfort

The world is grim and dangerous.  
If **anything becomes uncomfortable**, notify me **immediately**.

#### Game Balance & Fairness

The world is scaled to fit you—**mercenaries and adventurers**.

> “Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.”  
> Don’t expect to survive charging a Demi-Prince.

#### Rules Debates

I may **rule on the spot**.  
We’ll confirm rules **after the session** for future clarity.
