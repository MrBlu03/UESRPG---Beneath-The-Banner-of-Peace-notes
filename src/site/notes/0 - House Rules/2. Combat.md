# Beneath the Banner of Peace ‚Äì Combat Rules

## Action Economy Changes

### Ready Action & Swapping Weapons

In most cases, **you do not need to ready your weapon** at the start of combat. However, there are **two key exceptions**:

1. **Surprise**
   - If your character is surprised, you **must spend 1 Action Point (AP)** to perform a **Ready Action**.
   - This applies regardless of whether you are:
     - Drawing a one-handed weapon
     - Equipping a shield
     - Dual-wielding

2. **Swapping Weapons**
   - Swapping weapons always costs **1 AP**.
   - This includes complex transitions (e.g., from a two-handed weapon to a one-handed weapon and shield).

> üí° UESRPG is heavily balanced around **action economy**. Weapon management during combat can have significant tactical impact.

## Death & Resurrection

### Death

If or when a **player character (PC)** dies, you will go through the **character creation process** again, just as you did at the start of the campaign.

### Resurrection

Resurrection **is possible**, but extremely rare and difficult:

- Must occur **very quickly** after death.
- Usually requires **powerful forces**, such as:
  - The **Divines**
  - The **Vestige**
  - Other legendary artifacts or beings

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Death matters in Tamriel. Resurrection is a divine anomaly, not a convenience.
