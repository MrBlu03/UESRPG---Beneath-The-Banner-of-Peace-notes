# Action Economy Changes
## Ready Action & Swapping Weapons
Combat will in most cases not require you to ready your weapon. There is, however, two important exceptions: surprise and swapping weapons. 
If your character is surprised, you have to take the "Ready" action to putt out your weapon, spending ONE (1) Action Point, no matter if you are pulling out one weapon, a shield, or dual wielding.
Since UESRPG is heavily balanced towards action economy, swapping weapons will also require the spending of AP. This will ALWAYS only cost 1 AP, even if you are swapping from, for example, 2H to 1H + Shield and vice versa.
# Death & Resurrection
## Death
If, or when, a PC dies, we will go through the process of creating a new one like we did for the first.
## Resurrection
While resurrection is possible within the setting, it is exceedingly limited, either needing to happen VERY quickly, or being reserved for very powerful beings, like the Divines or the Vestige.
