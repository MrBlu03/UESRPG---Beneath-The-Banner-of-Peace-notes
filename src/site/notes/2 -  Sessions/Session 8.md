# Session 8 - 2025-06-21

## Summary
The party accepted a contract from [[Info/Characters/Hadvar\|Hadvar]] of Clan Cold-Moor to investigate a haunted hunting lodge east of [[Info/Locations/Riften\|Riften]]. After gathering information from the [[Info/Organizations/Cult_of_Ysmir\|Cult of Ysmir]] and local bards, they discovered the lodge was built on ancient ground where a massacre occurred. At the lodge, they encountered the spirit of [[Info/Characters/Lagetha\|Lagetha]] and the undead [[Info/Characters/Sven\|Sven]]. [[Info/Characters/Kirya\|Kirya]] retrieved the mask and returned to [[Info/Locations/Riften\|Riften]] for supplies while the others prepared a funeral pyre for the spirits. The party discovered the remains of [[Info/Characters/Lagetha\|Lagetha]] in the well, including her head and a necklace, and found a locked box that [[Info/Characters/Sven\|Sven]] requested be burned.
