# ðŸ–¤ The Blackfeather Court

## Overview
The Blackfeather Court (also simply called "the Blackfeather") is a mysterious and secretive organization first mentioned by the [[Info/Characters/Talking_Fox\|Talking Fox]] during the party's return journey from [[Info/Locations/Greenwall\|Greenwall]]. They appear to be connected to ancient rituals, draconic magic, and possibly the [[Info/Locations/Nocturnal_Realm\|Nocturnal Realm]]. This organization appears to be the same as or connected to the Court of Crows that was previously mentioned.

## Known Information
- "The Blackfeather aren't known to many, their founder wishes it so" - direct quote from the [[Info/Characters/Talking_Fox\|Talking Fox]]
- Connected to a scroll written in the language of dragons that [[Info/Characters/Onasha\|Onasha]] possesses
- The scroll appears to be a summoning ritual of some kind
- When a piece of the scroll was burned, it turned to tar and rose into the sky
- Has some connection to the mysterious figure known as "The Vestige"
- May be related to the black feathers found by the party

## Members
- No other specific members have been identified
- The organization's founder intentionally keeps the group secret

## Activities
- Potentially involved in summoning rituals
- Connected to draconic magic and dragon language
- May use messenger crows as agents or spies
- Appears to have ties to [[Info/Locations/Nocturnal_Realm\|Everglow]] in the Nocturnal Realm

## Locations
- May have a presence in the [[Info/Locations/Nocturnal_Realm\|Nocturnal Realm]] (Everglow)
- No known bases in the mortal realm have been identified

## Connections
- **[[Info/Characters/Talking_Fox\|Talking Fox]]**: Possessed knowledge about the organization and warned of their secrecy
- **[[Info/Characters/Onasha\|Onasha]]**: Possesses a scroll connected to their rituals
- **[[Info/Characters/Speaks-Spells-Gently\|Speaks-Spells-Gently]]**: Familiar with the Court and may have encountered them during his studies at [[Info/Locations/Shad_Astula\|Shad Astula]]
- **[[Info/Characters/Archmagus_Mortgren\|Archmagus Mortgren]]**: May have knowledge about their connection to the mysterious black feathers
- **The Vestige**: Named as the founder of the organization

## Threat Assessment
Unknown, but multiple sources have urged caution:
- The [[Info/Characters/Talking_Fox\|Talking Fox]] warned about their rituals
- Their connection to summoning rituals suggests potential danger
- Their ability to monitor the party (through crows or other means) indicates substantial reach

## Notes
- The translation of the scroll evoked a sense of dread in [[Info/Characters/Onasha\|Onasha]]
- After the interaction with the fox regarding this organization, the party felt they were being watched
- Previously referred to as the "Court of Crows" in some contexts
- The name "Blackfeather Court" combines elements from both names
- May be accessible for consultation through [[Info/Characters/Speaks-Spells-Gently\|Speaks-Spells-Gently]] or [[Info/Characters/Archmagus_Mortgren\|Archmagus Mortgren]]
- Connection to "The Vestige" may be important for future investigations
