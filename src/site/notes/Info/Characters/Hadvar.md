# Hadvar

## Basic Information
- **Race**: Nord
- **Occupation**: Noble of Clan Cold-Moor
- **Location**: [[Info/Locations/The_Sleeping_Stag\|The Sleeping Stag]], [[Info/Locations/Riften\|Riften]]
- **Status**: Alive

## Description
Well-dressed man who looks too wealthy to be a local. Often seen with his boots on a chair, wine half gone, and a plate of lamb and veggies.

## Background
- Recently inherited his family's old hunting lodge east of [[Info/Locations/Riften\|Riften]]
- The lodge is located near [[Info/Locations/Khaarus_Hollow\|Khaarus Hollow]], at the fork in the road where the woods thicken
- The lodge was built on ancient ground where a massacre occurred during the First Empire (at least 4,000 years ago)

## Current Situation
- Experienced haunting phenomena at the lodge:
  - Doors opening on their own
  - Hearth lighting itself
  - Whispers of his name from the rafters
  - Bear rug growling
  - Bed moving across the floor at midnight
- Offered a contract to clear the haunting for 200 gold each, one bottle of Cold-Moor Reserve, and items from the root cellar (excluding cursed items)

## Relationships
- **Clan Cold-Moor**: Member of the ancient clan, though most information about them has been struck from history
- **Local Bards**: Dismissed by [[Info/Characters/Senya\|Senya]] as being drunk and scared

## Notes
- Attempted to draw a map of the lodge location but it was poorly done
- The lodge has been abandoned longer than most people have been alive
- Locals avoid the area due to "bad air" and strange phenomena
