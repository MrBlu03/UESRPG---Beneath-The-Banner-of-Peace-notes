**Chapter 3: The Alchemist, The Mortician, and the Whispers in the Ice**  
**9th of Heartfire, 2E 600**

Some days had passed since their audience with Queen Freidr, each companion attending to their own matters. When they regrouped, it was by the bounty board in Riften’s square. One notice, penned in hurried script, stood out: Alara, the elderly alchemist known to many in the city, had not returned home. The same woman whose son, Hafjorg, they had met just days earlier. His worry was palpable, and when the group sought him out, he admitted his mother had been gone longer than usual. Alara often vanished for a day or two to gather herbs, but this had been too long. With more than sixty winters behind her, Hafjorg feared the worst—and begged them to find her before something else did.

Before leaving Riften, Onasha led the group to Sweaty Steel, a local forge run by siblings Svana and Bjorn. While Onasha sold off a sword retrieved from a bandit, they inquired about Alara. Svana confirmed the old woman’s routine wanderings, but her face tightened with concern upon hearing the details. Two nights gone was unusual indeed. She thanked the group for taking the matter seriously.

Following Alara’s trail south of Riften, the adventurers encountered Eydis, a rugged hunter hauling the carcass of a freshly killed elk. When asked, he recalled selling meat to an older woman two nights prior—likely Alara—who had then ventured south toward the forest. At their prompting, he warned them of the usual wildlife—wolves, a saber cat now and again—but also shared a darker tale: of Frost Trolls from Mount Fjelhorst. Decades ago, some had descended from the peaks and ravaged Nimalten, claiming the life of his father among many others. Thanking him, the party pressed on.

Signs of Alara were soon found: crushed flowers, trampled undergrowth, and a scrap of cloth caught on a thorn bush. Then, a herb basket left beside a scratched tree. Onasha inspected the bark and froze. Spriggan claws. Nearby, Kirya found a trail of blood, and the group braced for grim news. Following it, they reached a clearing—only to find wolves feasting on an elk, not a person. With slow, careful steps, they retreated.

Near the base of the mountain, they stumbled upon a modest campsite. A stew of potato and venison simmered gently over a fire. Sensing Alara’s presence nearby, they chose to wait. Onasha, ever the botanist, slipped into the woods to gather ingredients of her own.

Moments later, Alara emerged from a nearby cave, basket in hand, flanked by an unusually placid Spriggan. The old woman greeted them with warmth and laughter, explaining that she’d befriended the forest spirit decades ago. It had watched over her ever since. She invited them to share her stew.

As they ate, Alara regaled them with tales of old Skyrim, including mention of the ruins of Fjelhorst atop the mountain. Once a Dragon Cult stronghold, she claimed the Draugr—eternal guardians of the cult—still wandered its halls. Then her gaze fell on Durov. His shield bore a symbol she recognized but couldn’t place. Durov confessed that he suffered from amnesia, his past shrouded in mystery. Alara mentioned a Colovian acquaintance in the city of Faldarstad who might know more. Before parting, she gave the group a blue ribbon to deliver to Hafjorg, promising she’d return by dinner.

Back in Riften, Eirik the Quick, the city’s spry courier, flagged them down. Sigrid, the mortician, requested their presence at the Hall of the Dead.

First, they delivered the ribbon to Hafjorg. Tears welled in his eyes as he thanked them profusely and busied himself preparing the home for her return. With that, they made for the Hall.

Sigrid led them straight to the Dunmer's body. Her findings, she explained, were troubling. The poison used was far more complex than initially thought. Initially puzzled by the impossibility of masking so potent a nightshade brew, she suspected suicide. But the telltale drag marks on his legs proved otherwise.

She had brought a blood sample to Ralvard, a skilled alchemist. The results were chilling: the poison contained traces of vampire dust, shadow ichor, and twilight poison—an alchemical blend designed to mislead investigators. Whoever created it had access to rare ingredients, some of which could only be found in Oblivion itself. She had already informed the Queen’s guard and warned the group to tread carefully.

Leaving the Hall, the group passed the town crier in the market. News spread quickly: Greenwall, a northern town, had been swallowed by an unnatural blizzard. Roads were blocked by walls of dense ice, and travelers reported monstrous shapes moving within.

Compelled to investigate, they visited the mead hall of the Cult of Ysmir, where Gjellir Stormcrown greeted them. Towering above even Durov, Gjellir shared grim news. The ice around Greenwall was no natural force. People approaching the barriers had vanished, snatched by creatures phasing through the ice. He also mentioned that the Companions of Fallowstone Hall, led by their harbinger Vigrod Wraithbane, had established a war camp nearby and were actively working to rescue the town. Periwyn paled. She recognized the signs.

These were not just monsters—they were vampires. And not just any. Clan Volkihar. An ancient lineage, feared even among the undead, and unseen in Skyrim for centuries. Periwyn urged the group to steel themselves. The road ahead was far darker than any they had yet walked.
