**Chapter 5: Onwards to Greenwall**  
**18th–23rd of Heartfire, 2E 600**

The morning of the 18th dawned clear and cold, a final breath of autumn hanging in the air as the party made ready to leave Riften behind. After a hearty breakfast prepared by Astrid, the innkeeper’s daughter, Onasha and Periwyn paid a last visit to Alara’s shop, hoping to acquire Fire Salts for the journey. But the price proved too steep, and they left empty-handed. Outside, Bjorin loaded the final provisions onto the convoy’s carts, and at the stables, the group met their travel companions.

Leading the convoy was Hjar of Clan Black-Foot, a gruff but reliable warrior they had traveled with before. Alongside him were three members of the Cult of Ysmir: the stoic Harbinger Gjellir, the ever-watchful Beitild the Unwavering, and Olen the Mer-Killer, a lean and hawkish Nord known for his brutal honesty. The convoy departed just as the first sunlight spilled over the Velothi Mountains.

**Day 1**  
As the road wound its way through birch forests and craggy passes, the party grew accustomed to the rhythm of travel. Beitild struck up conversation with Kirya, eyeing the Khajiit curiously. She asked what brought Kirya so far from Elsweyr. Kirya replied quietly—she was searching for someone—but declined to elaborate. That evening, by firelight, Beitild prodded a bit more, sharing stories of her own youth among the Skaal and expressing an unexpected curiosity about her fellow travelers.

**Day 2**  
The second day passed under bright skies. Durov found himself sharing the reins with Gjellir and Olen. Their talk drifted from tactics to tales of old battles. When they asked Durov about his past, he admitted there was little he could recall before his mercenary days—his memory lost to some trauma he could not name. Gjellir observed that the crest on Durov's shield resembled that of Bruma’s old noble lines, though subtly different.

Later that day, Onasha approached Periwyn and inquired about her missing ear. Periwyn spoke plainly—she had lost it defending the temple of the Knights of Arkay during a vampire raid. That night, sleep did not come easy. Periwyn dreamed of her twin brother’s voice, distant and hollow, whispering only: "Survive."

**Day 3**  
A cold rain fell the next morning, soaking tents and cloaks. Fog drifted low over the road. Huddled around a struggling campfire, Gjellir told a grim tale of a company of Nord warriors who died to the last man, fighting to earn a place in Sovngarde. His voice was low and reverent—less for entertainment, more as remembrance.

**Day 4**  
The fog lingered into the next day. Overhead, bone hawks circled in ominous loops. Onasha took a shot with her bow and struck one cleanly from the sky. As it fell, Periwyn sketched the twisted corpse, noting its design for later study. Beitild explained that such creatures were often summoned for necromantic rituals—watchers for vampire thralls. Onasha gathered the remains, curious to see what secrets they might yield.

**Day 5**  
The road darkened. That afternoon, they found a grim sight—over a dozen corpses hanging from trees along the roadside, executed and left to rot. The sight triggered a sharp panic in Periwyn, who fell to her knees shaking. Durov, Olen, and Gjellir moved with solemn purpose, cutting the bodies down and building a pyre. There were no signs of who had done it—no banners, no tracks.

That night, the group lingered by the fire longer than usual. Periwyn opened up, recounting the night her home was overrun by vampires. Her parents and twin brother had been turned into bloodfiends—feral, twisted shadows of what they once were. They were put down in front of her by Sir Gareth, the knight who would later become her mentor. It was mercy, he had said. But the memory of their screams—and the cold resolve in Gareth’s eyes—never left her. Kirya, her voice low, shared her own loss: her home in Elsweyr, razed by a dragon years ago. As they spoke, Onasha noticed a strange crow perched nearby, its eyes locked on Periwyn. It did not move. It simply watched, unblinking.

**Day 6**  
By early afternoon, the sun vanished behind a curtain of unnatural clouds. A darkness fell—not merely shade, but something deeper. Periwyn recognized it instantly, chilled by the memory of Northpoint and the shadow that had fallen there. It was not just the absence of light—it was the presence of something else.

By evening, the party crested a final ridge and looked down upon Greenwall. What remained of it was barely a ruin. The war camp below was sparse—five Companions, battered but determined, led by the Harbinger Vigrod Wraithbane.

That night, a scouting party of Onasha, Kirya, and Beitild found a hidden smuggler’s tunnel to the west—a relic from the days of the Three Banners War, long forgotten but intact. Inside, damp and dark, it led beneath the fort.

With this new path, Vigrod and Durov crafted a daring plan:

- Rebuild the old trebuchets, scattered and broken, to rain chaos upon the fort and draw the enemy into the light.
- Infiltrate the stronghold through the tunnel during the assault, locate the source of the darkness, and destroy it before it could spread.

As the fires of camp burned low, the party rested under a sky thick with ash and cloud, knowing the battle was fast approaching—and what they faced inside Fort Greenwall would be unlike anything they had fought before.
