**Chapter 5: Onwards to Greenwall**  

**18th–23rd of Heartfire, 2E 600**

  
The morning of the 18th dawned clear and cold, a final breath of autumn hanging in the air as the party made ready to leave Riften behind. After a hearty breakfast prepared by Astrid, the innkeeper’s daughter, Durov, Kirya, and Onasha paid a last visit to Alara’s shop, hoping to acquire Fire Salts for the journey. But the price proved too steep, and they left empty-handed. Meanwhile, Periwyn remained at the inn, eating her breakfast alone on the upper balcony and sketching quietly in her journal as the city stirred below. When the others returned, Durov tossed a small pebble up to the balcony to catch her attention. Periwyn looked down, mildly annoyed, and called out that she would've heard them had they simply called her name. She tucked her journal away with a sigh and rose to join them downstairs without another word. Not long after, Eirik the Quick, the ever-hurried courier, arrived with a message: Hjar of Clan Black-Foot was waiting for them at the stables.

  

When the party arrived at the stables, Durov joined Ralof and Hrongar in loading supplies onto the cart, while Bjorin, the innkeeper, stood nearby, overseeing the delivery of provisions. Moments later, the ground began to tremble faintly under the approach of heavy, metal-clad footsteps—Gjellir the Harbinger had arrived, flanked by the sharp-eyed Beitild the Unwavering and the lean, hawkish Olen the Mer-Killer. These three, members of the Cult of Ysmir, joined Hjar of Clan Black-Foot, the convoy's gruff but reliable leader and an old acquaintance of the party. With everyone assembled, the convoy set off just as sunlight crested the Velothi Mountains, casting long golden rays across the road ahead.

  

**Day 1**  

As the road wound its way through birch forests and craggy passes, the party grew accustomed to the rhythm of travel. Beitild struck up conversation with Kirya, eyeing the Khajiit curiously. She asked what brought Kirya so far from Elsweyr. Kirya replied quietly—she was searching for someone—but declined to elaborate. That evening, by firelight, Beitild prodded a bit more, sharing stories of her own youth among the Skaal and expressing an unexpected curiosity about her fellow travelers.

  

**Day 2**  

The second day passed under bright skies. Durov found himself sharing the reins with Gjellir and Olen. Their talk drifted from tactics to tales of old battles. When they asked Durov about his past, he admitted there was little he could recall before his mercenary days—his memory lost to some trauma he could not name. Gjellir observed that the crest on Durov's shield resembled that of Bruma’s old noble lines, though subtly different.

  

Later that day, Onasha approached Periwyn and inquired about her missing ear. Periwyn spoke plainly—she had lost it defending the temple of the Knights of Arkay during a vampire raid. That night, sleep did not come easy. Periwyn dreamed of her twin brother’s voice, distant and hollow, whispering only: "Survive."

  

**Day 3**  

A cold rain fell the next morning, soaking tents and cloaks. Fog drifted low over the road. Huddled around a struggling campfire, Gjellir told a grim tale of a company of Nord warriors who died to the last man, fighting to earn a place in Sovngarde. His voice was low and reverent—less for entertainment, more as remembrance.

  

**Day 4**  

The fog lingered into the next day. Overhead, bone hawks circled in ominous loops. Onasha took a shot with her bow and struck one cleanly from the sky. As it fell, Periwyn sketched the twisted corpse, noting its design for later study. Beitild explained that such creatures were often summoned for necromantic rituals—watchers for vampire thralls. Onasha gathered the remains, curious to see what secrets they might yield.

  

**Day 5**  

The road darkened. That afternoon, they found a grim sight—over a dozen corpses hanging from trees along the roadside, executed and left to rot. The sight triggered a sharp panic in Periwyn, who fell to her knees shaking. Durov, Olen, and Gjellir moved with solemn purpose, cutting the bodies down and building a pyre. There were no signs of who had done it—no banners, no tracks.

  

That night, Periwyn was startled awake by a vivid nightmare, her scream piercing the stillness of camp. She thrashed in her bedroll, striking her head against the tent pole. The noise roused both Kirya and Onasha—Kirya was first to approach, gently pulling open the tent flap to find Periwyn sitting upright, pale and breathing heavily.

  

Kirya knelt beside her and asked softly what had happened. Periwyn, eyes distant, admitted she suffered from frequent nightmares—remnants of what the vampires had taken from her. She didn’t go into detail, only saying that many she loved had been lost, and that she feared sleep as much as she needed it. She confessed to staying up late and waking early to avoid the stillness that let memories creep in.

  

Kirya nodded in understanding, revealing she too had lost loved ones in Elsweyr, and that it was easy to drown in grief if one wasn't careful. "We can’t let the things that took them win twice," she said. The two shared a quiet moment, a fragile solidarity beneath the dark sky.

  

From her own tent, Onasha watched silently. Her eyes shifted to the fire pit where a crow had landed on the cooking rack. It sat perfectly still, eyes fixed on Periwyn. It did not caw. It did not move. It simply stared, unblinking.

  

**Day 6**  

By early afternoon, the sun vanished behind a curtain of unnatural clouds. A darkness fell—not merely shade, but something deeper. Periwyn recognized it instantly, chilled by the memory of Northpoint and the shadow that had fallen there. It was not just the absence of light—it was the presence of something else.

  

By evening, the party crested a final ridge and looked down upon Greenwall. What remained of it was barely a ruin. The war camp below was sparse—five Companions, battered but determined, led by the Harbinger Vigrod Wraithbane.

  

That night, a scouting party of Onasha, Kirya, Durov, and Beitild found a hidden smuggler’s tunnel to the west—a relic from the days of the Three Banners War, long forgotten but intact. Inside, damp and dark, it led beneath the fort.

  

Periwyn, still shaken from the days prior, had stayed behind. Vigrod instructed her to investigate the remains of the old trebuchets, scattered and broken among the ruined war machines of the camp.

  

Upon the scouts’ return, Vigrod and Gjellir gathered around the fire to draw up a daring plan:

- Rebuild the trebuchets to bombard the fort, creating chaos and forcing the vampires into the open.

- Infiltrate the stronghold through the tunnel during the assault, locate the source of the darkness, and destroy it before it could spread.

  

As the fires of camp burned low, the party rested under a sky thick with ash and cloud, knowing the battle was fast approaching—and what they faced inside Greenwall would be unlike anything they had fought before.
