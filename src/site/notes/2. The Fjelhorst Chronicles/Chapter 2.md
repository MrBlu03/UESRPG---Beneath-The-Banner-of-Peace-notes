**7th of Heartfire, 2E 600 (continued)**

Treva's Bend sat low along the riverbank, its muddy paths and gray sky mirroring the mood of its people. When the party arrived, Alderman Torgir greeted them with no warmth. Suspicion weighed heavy in his tone—until they mentioned Queen Freidr. At that, his posture straightened, and though his words remained guarded, he allowed them into his confidence. Clan Snow-Shod, he confirmed, had turned the river against them. And the rumors? True. Torgir had been meeting a so-called "concerned kinsman" under cover of darkness, near the dam constructed by the Snow-Shods upstream.

The party followed the river’s course to that dam, trekking along a rugged trail flanked by drooping trees and moss-covered stones. Snow-Shod guards stood posted there, stiff-backed and armed. They refused passage—until Durov stepped forward, voice firm and low, invoking the Queen’s name. Reluctantly, the guards relented.

The dam reeked of tampering. Broken tools lay discarded in the reeds, and a trail of footprints cut into the mud, leading toward the dense woods. A thin curl of smoke rose above the canopy—not far. Memories of their last ambush lingered like a shadow over the party’s movements. Durov and Periwyn advanced openly, while Onasha kept a loose distance with bow in hand. Kirya vanished into the brush, silent as moonlight.

But the clearing they reached held no foe. Only a smoldering campfire, and the lingering heat of a presence just fled. Durov searched the tent and found another note bearing the now-familiar sigil of the coiled serpent. Kirya spotted drag marks near the firepit—fresh—and Onasha retrieved the charred fragments of another note from the embers.

The trail led them deeper into the trees. And there, at the base of a gnarled oak, they found the kinsman: a Dunmer man, face slack, limbs askew, purple staining his lips. Poison. A brutal one—concentrated nightshade. Onasha’s spines flared at the sight. She spat, calling it justice. Periwyn, with quiet understanding, offered her warhammer. Onasha took it without pause, and with a single strike, ensured the Dunmer would not rise again.

His name, they learned from a journal at his side, was Adrith Velan. He had not come to help Treva’s Bend—but to inflame it. Working for the serpent faction, Adrith had blocked the flow regulators in the dam to stoke discord between the fishermen and the Snow-Shods.

Durov slung the corpse over his shoulder with the ease of habit, dragging it back to the dam like refuse. Onasha dove into the frigid water, clearing the blockages with practiced precision. The dam groaned—and the river surged anew.

Back in Treva’s Bend, Torgir met them with something like gratitude. He promised to reach out to Clan Snow-Shod, to attempt a fragile reconciliation. Durov, unimpressed by Torgir’s earlier frost, asked for compensation. The alderman hesitated—then conceded. Gold would come, once the nets were full again.

They returned to Riften with Adrith’s corpse in tow, delivering it to Sigrid in the Hall of the Dead. The mortician agreed to study the poison and send word of her findings.

As they passed through the market, a drunken brawl had drawn a small crowd. Durov, ever the opportunist, placed a bet on the larger brawler—and walked away grinning, a few coins heavier.

At Mistveil Keep, Queen Freidr received them once more. Their reward was generous—but her unease was plain. The serpent sigil, and the deadly poison, pointed to something larger than a simple border feud. Before dismissing them, she gave a quiet warning: their service may soon be required again.

That night, the party returned to the Wanderer’s Rest. Mead flowed freely, firelight danced across worn wood and weary faces, and—for a time—the weight of the day slipped from their shoulders.
