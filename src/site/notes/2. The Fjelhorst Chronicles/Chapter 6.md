**Chapter 6: Into the Storm**
**24th of Heartfire, 2E 600**

The party stirred from uneasy dreams into a darkness that clung like fog—not the black of night, but the unnatural shade of the eclipse. No dawn light crept through the trees, only the faint glow of campfires flickering in the gloom. Hillevi, the Companions’ healer, stood over them with a tray of warm bread and porridge, her expression calm despite the dread hanging in the air.

Beyond the cold embers of the camp, the massive silhouettes of rebuilt trebuchets loomed—silent sentinels, assembled during the night under the cover of shadow.

While the others took their meal in silence, Periwyn opened her journal, carefully sketching the war tent—every fold and crease—as if to trap some sense of order amid the chaos.

Before the morning’s mission briefing, Onasha approached Periwyn to discuss the Bone Hawk she’d shot down days earlier. Its unnatural composition gnawed at her thoughts. Periwyn, ever curious, admitted to having dabbled in Necromancy, and suggested they might repurpose the creature as a scout. Onasha's distrust was immediate and instinctive, but after some consideration, she agreed to try—in seclusion, and with caution. If it proved too dangerous, they would harvest the remains instead.

Afterward, Onasha struck up a conversation with Hillevi, curious about how the healer had come to join the Companions. Hillevi’s answer came easily—she had joined six winters ago, drawn by a desire for glory and a wish to help others. To Onasha, the lack of hidden motive was unsettling, even suspicious, but Hillevi’s demeanor remained open and sincere. She spoke at length about the Companions, describing them as an ancient order of warriors spread across Skyrim, their lineage stretching back to Ysgramor, the fabled hero of the Merethic Era.

Soon after, Vigrod summoned the party to the war tent.

There, beneath heavy canvas and maps inked with battle-lines, the party received their mission. They would infiltrate Greenwall through a forgotten tunnel, a remnant of the Three Banners War when smugglers used the fort as a base. While the Companions launched burning debris from trebuchets as a distraction, the party was to slip through the tunnel and locate the source of the eclipse. If there were survivors, they were to be sent through the tunnel and into the safety of the western woods.

Vigrod clasped their shoulders one by one. “Gods give you strength,” he said. “And may we meet again in Sovngarde.”

The tunnel’s entrance lay beneath a bed of fallen leaves on a quiet hilltop—a weathered trapdoor that groaned as they pulled it open. Below, a wooden ladder descended into a flickering passage. Durov took the lead, shield raised, his broad back guarding the others as they descended. Periwyn lingered near the rear, her steps hesitant, fear tightening her chest.

The passage opened into a forgotten storage room. Dusty crates lined the walls, and a handful of old books caught Onasha’s eye: Herbalist’s Guide to Skyrim, Sithis, and Herbane’s Bestiary: Hagravens. She tucked them away for later study.

On the table lay a smuggler’s ledger—mundane entries on skooma... and a chilling list of slaves. Onasha’s expression hardened. Her scales dried in silent revulsion.

Further in, the tunnel brought them to what remained of the smugglers’ living quarters—bedrolls, rusted shackles, and crumbling walls. It looked like a dead end, until Kirya’s sharp eyes noticed something off about one of the walls. On closer inspection, a wooden panel was slightly offset, hiding something behind it. With a grunt, Durov stepped forward and brought his axe crashing through the wood, revealing on the ther side the inn's cellar.

There, among cracked casks and broken shelves, Durov paused to sample an old keg of mead, remarking on its sharp, berry tang.

The main floor of the inn was worse. Furniture lay overturned. Bodies slumped on the ground, torn by claw marks. The walls trembled with the distant impact of trebuchets.

They split up to search. In the innkeeper’s quarters, Periwyn discovered a locked safe. With Kirya’s deft fingers and a few snapped lockpicks, it opened to reveal gold, a ledger, and a journal. Its pages painted a grim picture: ghost lights in the hills, hunters returning empty-handed, and four cloaked “nobles” who paid for a week in advance, only to vanish that same night. Periwyn and Onasha both recognized one of the names: Tharn—a name belonging only to a powerful Cyrodiilic family, high on the Elder Council. These had been aliases.

Outside, the ground was crusted in permafrost. Flaming debris rained from above. The sky was alive with the fluttering wings of bats—scouts, perhaps, flying toward the Companions’ camp. The party pressed on, moving carefully toward the keep, nestled on a hill beyond the central courtyard.

They detoured through nearby homes in search of survivors. One house, attached to a smithy, held only chaos—shattered tables, scattered belongings. Onasha found dried Elf’s Ear hanging by the extinguished hearth; Durov recovered a few corundum ingots from the basement.

The second house was quieter. The upstairs still held some semblance of order. But the basement...

The basement revealed a scene of horror.

In the gloom stood a ritual circle: candles, dried blood, human remains—heart, ribs, skull, and flesh. Onasha froze. When Periwyn coaxed her back, she explained in hushed tones what they were seeing: the Black Sacrament. Someone here had summoned the Dark Brotherhood.

Among the scattered offerings lay an ebony dagger etched with strange runes, and a copy of 'A Kiss, Sweet Mother'.

As they turned to leave, a shadow moved at the top of the stairs. A figure descended slowly, foot by foot, cloaked in silence and menace. The party drew their weapons, but the figure did not strike. Instead, it stepped to the circle and, with a single motion, reignited the extinguished candles. The air thickened. The figure solidified—an assassin, answering the Sacrament.

He spoke—calm, precise. The summoner was absent, he explained, but he would offer his services nonetheless. When he uttered Periwyn’s surname, the familiarity in his voice turned the air brittle. Startled, she demanded to know how he knew it. His reply was cryptic: "A name like theirs carries its weight across all harbors, even those less visited." The room fell into tense deliberation, the group's purpose shifting. Rather than pursuing vengeance against a vampire from Periwyn’s past, they tasked him with a more urgent target: the one behind Greenwall’s eclipse. When Durov's blood touched the contract parchment, the assassin nodded once—and vanished.

“And so begins a contract, bound by blood.”

Fearing the keep still held too many dangers, the party waited inside the house for the assassin to return. The thunder of trebuchets faded. Then, at last, a faint, golden light pierced the clouds. Sunlight.

They rushed to the keep, drawn by the shrieking death-cries of vampires burning in the dawn.

Inside, they found only horror.

Bones and flesh spiraled in deliberate patterns across the stone floor. Flayed skin hung from broken spears. Symbols daubed in blood coated the walls. At the center, an altar of black stone—Molag Bal, the God of Domination, leering in monstrous glory. From his gaping maw spilled blood, thick and dark, flowing into a basin beneath. Suspended above the basin, a crimson orb pulsed with faint, malevolent light.

Behind the altar hung a man—crucified on rusted spears. Barely alive.

Periwyn and Durov rushed to the man's side. She steadied his shallow breath with a touch of healing magic, while Durov uncorked a potion and tipped it between his lips. For a moment, there was hope—then his body convulsed, going rigid before falling deathly still. Paralyzed, but alive. With no better option, they laid him gently against the wall and turned toward the pulsing orb.

It radiated the unmistakable presence of Coldharbour.

Onasha’s arrows bounced off it like pebbles. Periwyn and Durov tried the side doors, but thick ice sealed them shut.

At last, the Companions arrived. But their numbers were fewer—Beitild and Olen had fallen in the assault. Periwyn’s grief erupted in fury, and her warhammer struck the ice wall, sending cracks spidering across it.

A sound broke the stillness—a heavy thud.

From above, a severed head landed at their feet. Fanged. Ancient.

Hillevi gasped, eyes wide.

High on a torch sconce, the assassin stood, poised and silent. His task was complete—the vampire lord lay slain.

He didn’t ask for payment. Instead, he lingered, studying them with quiet interest. His voice, when it came, was low and cryptic.

“My masters find your story fascinating. They see great potential in you. We will certainly meet again.”

Before he turned to leave, Durov flipped him a single gold coin. “This will do—for now.”

And just like that, he vanished into shadow.
