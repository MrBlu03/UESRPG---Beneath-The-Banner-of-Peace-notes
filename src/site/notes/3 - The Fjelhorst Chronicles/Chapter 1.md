**7th of Heartfire, 2E 600**

The summons came quietly, yet with the weight of royal urgency. Four strangers found themselves called to Mistveil Keep, summoned not by coin alone but by circumstance. Durov, a broad-shouldered Colovian mercenary, eager to forge a name worthy of song. Kirya, a sharp-eyed Khajiiti wanderer, recently parted from her caravan. Onasha, an Argonian chemist with a scholar’s calm and a hunter’s instinct. And Periwyn Lunclaire, a Breton knight of Arkay, her path carved by flame and devotion—and a deep-rooted hatred of the undead.

Within the stone halls of Mistveil, Queen Freidr received them with little ceremony. Her throne offered no comfort; her voice carried the burden of rule. A river near Riften, once the lifeblood of its farmlands and fishing villages, had run low. In its wake rose bitter accusation. Clan Snow-Shod—an Old Clan of proud farmers—claimed innocence, while the fishermen of Treva’s Bend cried sabotage. With her guards tangled in old loyalties, the Queen sought judgment from those with no stake in the feud.

The party accepted the task. From the Queen’s steward they learned the truth that court whispers refused to say aloud: the Snow-Shods had dug new irrigation tunnels upstream, and the fishermen downstream had paid the price. Starving nets. Dry banks.

But before setting off to Treva’s Bend, the party took to the streets of Riften, hoping to gather whispers beneath the noise of the market. A cabbage merchant, eager to part with secrets for a pouch of coin, offered a curious tale: villagers meeting with a cloaked stranger beneath the moonless sky—and none willing to speak of it in daylight.

Southward, the road wound along the river’s thinning edge. Dried reeds crunched beneath boot and paw. Then, without warning, figures burst from the brush. Bandits. Steel rang, arrows flew, and blood struck the dust. Periwyn was the storm—her warhammer rising and falling in brutal rhythm, the bandit leader’s skull caving beneath righteous fury.

When the last man surrendered, he gave more than his name—Alaric. He gave up the truth. They hadn’t come for gold or hunger. They’d been hired to block the road. And the seal on their instructions bore a coiled serpent, etched in wax.

With Alaric bound, the party turned back to Riften. Captain Harvold took him into custody, handed over the bounty, and frowned at the serpent mark. He urged the group to bring it to the Queen directly—whatever this was, it reached beyond a simple feud.

The journey had begun with water—but it was already leading somewhere deeper.
