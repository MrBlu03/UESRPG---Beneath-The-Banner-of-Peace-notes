**Chapter 4: Silence in the Keep**  
**15th of Heartfire, 2E 600**

During their days training with the Cult of Ysmir, the party was once again summoned to Mistveil Keep. On their way there, they stopped by The Honed Edge, a weaponsmith just a few houses down from the keep. Kirya had been there the day before, and noted that the owner was offering a discount on silver weaponry to any brave souls heading out to Greenwall. The party took the offer, with Onasha and Kirya each buying a bundle of silver arrows. While those were being assembled, the owner, Hilldis, revealed that her family had close ties to the vampires attacking Greenwall. Back during the early First Era, her ancestral clan owned a castle off the coast of Haafingar, Skyrim's northwestern Hold. During a bloody conflict that spanned many years, the castle was besieged and captured by Clan Volkihar. The survivors fled and resettled in the mountains of the Reach. She wished them luck as they departed.

Upon arriving at Mistveil Keep, they caught Queen Freidr mid-conversation with a darkly dressed man who spoke of prophecy, a scroll, and someone named Harkon. He was heading to the ruins atop Fjelhorst to ensure nothing buried there had awakened. Before leaving, he introduced himself to Onasha as Archmagus Mortgren. He discussed a black feather she had found a few days earlier, confirming its magical nature and advising her to keep it close. Then, without further delay, he left for the mountain.

When the Queen finally called them forward, her demeanor was colder than before. Harmugstahl, a garrison and training ground for Riften's scouts, had gone silent three nights prior. Scouts sent to investigate never returned. A hunter, Eydis, had passed the area and reported no signs of battle, only an eerie stillness. A strange chill had come over him during his visit, and later, he was found dead in his home—frozen from the inside out, despite no trace of snow or struggle. The Queen tasked the group with uncovering the truth.

Heading southeast, the party noticed crows tracking them overhead. Onasha lured one closer with bread and discovered it could speak. It introduced itself as Baron Jangleplume and issued cryptic warnings: "You're too late," "The keep is Hollow," "He waits beneath the bones." Then it vanished into the trees.

Harmugstahl was eerily lifeless. Outside, there were no tracks but their own. Snow lay undisturbed in the courtyard, save for the well, where Durov discovered a severed, frozen hand. Two doors lay before them—one leading into the main keep and another to the side. They chose the side door, entering the barracks.

Inside was a nightmare made real. Soldiers stood frozen mid-action: some praying, others writing letters or reaching for weapons. The torches glowed dim and cold. Durov approached one figure—its eyes moved. They were alive, yet trapped. Then came the whispers: "Gareth's little stray... still chasing ghosts?"—a voice sharp with malice, aimed at Periwyn. In fury, she hurled a dagger, shattering one of the soldiers. Kirya noticed movement in a mirror, but nothing when she turned—only another whisper, softer and somehow sorrowful: "You shouldn't be here."

The group pressed on to the main hall. In the entrance, food sat rotting on the table, drinks frozen in mugs, and more frozen guards watched in silence. They climbed a staircase to the overseer's quarters.

Inside, the overseer sat frozen over his journal, the final line written: "It is inside now." The air thickened. A voice, cold and smooth, filled the room: "All that faith. All that fire. And still, you are afraid." It taunted their devotion, mocked their prayers. Kirya glimpsed a reflection in the window—a dark-furred Khajiit in the snow. When she blinked, she was gone. The shutters rattled despite no wind. The scent of fresh blood filled the room—though no source was found. Then, soldiers’ eyes began to track them. A breath exhaled from the shadows—ice-cold and invisible.

They left the frozen overseer by the entrance to the main hall—too heavy to carry far—before heading down a corridor toward the dungeons. A trail of black feathers guided them to a lone open cell. The air grew heavy, as if crushed beneath invisible weight. Inside was a cracked mirror. In it, Kirya saw the Khajiit again—this time behind her. "They left them for you," she said.

A wind rushed through the hall, extinguishing torches and plunging them into darkness. Rustling sounds filled the silence—movement, not footsteps. In the dust, two symbols appeared. One, a coiled serpent—they had seen it before. The other, unfamiliar.

A second, stronger gust slammed doors shut, rattled chains, and toppled a lantern. Then—nothing.

The presence had gone.

Upstairs, the frozen soldiers were gone—only a fine, snow-like dust remained. Onasha gathered a sample before they returned to Riften.

Back at Mistveil Keep, the Queen heard their report. The silence at Harmugstahl was no fluke—it was the first blow in something far worse. She spoke of needing more than warriors—she needed hunters. She turned to each of them with purpose:

Periwyn, trained by the Knights of Arkay, fearless against the undead. Durov, steadfast even when the horrors of Harmugstahl unfolded around him. Onasha, whose mind and skill could unravel the alchemy infecting their land. Kirya, who moved unseen and heard truths others would never know.

She offered them a name: the Fangs of Fjelhorst. Hunters of the serpent. With her coin, her trust, and her charge to strike at what lurked in the shadows. The Queen asked if they would accept.

And with that, the party’s next chapter began.
